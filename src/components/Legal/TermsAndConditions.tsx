          Use of Cookies The Amplified EMS website may use “cookies” to help you
          personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is
          placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used
          to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are
          uniquely assigned to you, and can only be read by a web server in the
          domain that issued the cookie to you. One of the primary purposes of
          cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The
          purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web server that you have returned
          to a specific page. For example, if you personalize Amplified EMS
          pages, or register with Amplified EMS site or services, a cookie helps
          Amplified EMS to recall your specific information on subsequent
          visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal
          information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on.
